# watchmaker-face-scripts
A collection of background scripts for my Watchmaker faces.
I've got a Huawei Watch, all my watch faces are designed for that resolution and shape.


# Text Clock
A 12- or 24-hour text-based clock, with up to four lines of text centered vertically. Currently using BebasNeue size 72 for the font, so spacing has that in mind.

Plans:
- Add lower/uppercase configurability
- Generalize time-to-text conversion for use in stopwatch and other systems

# Sun and Moon
Tracks the rotation values for a sun/moon pair that arc across the top half of the face according to weather's sunrise and sunset times. Also provides angle values for a corresponding shadow to be applied to visible elements.
